  Linktastic App uses a Layer based concept. Each layer has its own
  functionality and every layer above uses the features of the one below.

# Concept

Linktastic App is based on React Most Wanted layers/shells**:

* **base-shell** - The base for every LNK project. It includes the management of the \`Auth\` state, Internationalization state, the basic UI Layout, and the routing.
* **mui-shell** -  This layer includes Material-UI design into the base-shell with handy components like Page, a responsive Menu, and settings for language.
* **lnk-shell** - This layer includes all the features from the previous ones and adds integration to Firebase by providing handy tools to kick start a new React project with the full power of Firebase.
